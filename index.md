### Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

**The most interesting topic covered this quarter is privacy concerns in data practices, particularly the innovative methods like Lean Privacy Review (LPR) that streamline privacy feedback collection. LPR allows companies to gather user concerns through crowd workers, enabling rapid and low-cost privacy reviews, which is critical for improving data-driven systems in a user-friendly way.**


**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  

**For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate how adaptive privacy feedback systems, like LPR, could be integrated with machine learning models to automatically flag data practices that raise privacy concerns. This could involve designing a system that predicts privacy risks based on data patterns and crowdsourced feedback, helping practitioners preemptively adjust their data strategies.**

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

**A potential change I would make to the current project is to expand the definition of privacy interactions beyond consent, influence, and request to include elements like auditability and data governance. These additional interactions would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of privacy risks and make the system more adaptable to future regulations or user expectations.**

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  

**I would be interested in exploring techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to analyze free-text feedback from users or crowd workers, and unsupervised machine learning to cluster similar privacy concerns. These techniques could enhance the ability to automatically categorize and prioritize feedback, making the system more efficient.**
