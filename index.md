### Introduction

**PrivacyVerb introduces a reusable, verb-centric approach to privacy threat modeling, shifting away from the conventional case-by-case, noun-centric design process. By abstracting privacy-relevant actions into structured verb-based units across data flows, stakeholder interactions, and individual design choices, PrivacyVerb enables practitioners to systematically compare and reuse privacy decisions. This approach improves efficiency, consistency, and accessibility, making privacy engineering more scalable and reducing the expertise needed to design privacy-sensitive data practices.**
